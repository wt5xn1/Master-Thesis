\chapter{The Translating Coil Magnetometer}
The measurement system that will be analyzed in this thesis consists
of a round PCB with multiple different coils. These coils are in the shapes
of disks or annulus segments. A render of the pcb can be seen in figure
\ref{fig:pcb}. The PCB is moved longitudinally inside the magnet aperture,
whereupon the coils pick up the magnetic flux.

\section{PCB printed coils}
The disks are denoted $D_l$ and the 
annulus segments by $Q_{q, l}$ where $l$ denotes radial layer and 
$q$ denotes quadrant.
