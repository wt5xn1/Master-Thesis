At CERN, a new electron cooler is being commissioned for the AD experiment.
This cooler shoots electrons into ion-beam path. These electrons then
collide with the beam particles, and momentum is transferred from the 
beam particles to the electrons. The electrons are then steered away
from the beam path, into an electron collector.

In the beam path drift of the cooler, a solenoid magnet is used to
orient the electron path. This magnet comes with strict requirements on
field quality, in the order of $\vec{B}_\perp / \vec{B}_\parallel < 10\mathrm{E}{-10}$.
A new measurement system for solenoids has been proposed, using coils wound 
on a pcb. This pcb is then translated through the solenoid aperture, to obtain
maps of the magnetic field. In this thesis, the metrological characterization of
this system is presented, along with some post processing methods.
